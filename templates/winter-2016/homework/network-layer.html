# Network Layer

1. Kurose & Ross, Chapter 4, Problem P9.

    Consider the switch shown below. Suppose that all datagrams have
    the same fixed length, that the switch operates in a slotted,
    synchronous manner, and that in one time slot a datagram can be
    transferred from an input port to an output port. The switch
    fabric is a crossbar so that at most one datagram can be
    transferred to a given output port in a time slot, but different
    output ports can receive datagrams from different input ports in a
    single time slot. What is the minimal number of time slots needd
    to transfer the packets shown from input ports to their output
    pots, assuming any input queue scheduling order you want (i.e., it
    need not have HOL blocking)? What is the largest number of slots
    needed, assuming the worst-case scheduling order you can devise,
    assuming that a non-empty input queue is never idle?

1. Kurose & Ross, Chapter 4, Problem P10.

    Consider a datagram network using 32-bit host addresses. Suppose a
    router has four links, numbered 0 through 3, and packets are to be
    forwarded to the link interfaces as follows:

    ![router](/static/img/kurose/fig04_p9.png)


    a. Provide a forwarding table that has five entries, uses longest
    prefix matching, and forwards packets to the correct link
    interfaces.

    b. Describe how your forwarding table determines the appropriate
    link interface for datagrams with destination addresses:

    11001000 10010001 01010001 01010101
    <br>11100001 01000000 11000011 00111100
    <br>11100001 10000000 00010001 01110111

1. Kurose & Ross, Chapter 4, Problem P13.

    Consider a router that interconnects three subnets: Subnet 1,
    Subnet 2, and Subnet 3. Suppose all of the interfaces in each of
    these three subnets are required to have the prefix
    223.1.17/24. Also suppose that Subnet 1 is required to support at
    least 62 interfaces, Subnet 2 is to support at least 95 interfaces, and
    Subnet 3 is to support at least 16 interfaces. Provide three network
    addresses (of the form a.b.c.d/x) that satisfy these constraints.

1. Kurose & Ross, Chapter 4, Problem P19.

    Consider sending a 2400-byte datagram into a link that has an MTU
    of 700 bytes. Suppose the original datagram is stamped with the
    identification number 422. How many fragments are generated? What
    are the values in the various fields in the IP datagram(s)
    generated related to fragmentation?

1. Kurose & Ross, Chapter 4, Problem P31.

    Consider the three-node topology shown below. Rather than having
    the link costs shown in the figure, the link costs are c(x,y) = 3,
    c(y,z) = 6, c(z,x) = 4. Compute the distance tables after the
    initialization step and after each iteration of a synchronous
    version of the distance-vector algorithm.

1. Kurose & Ross, Chapter 4, Problem P38.

    Consider the network shown below, with BGP running as the inter-AS
    routing protocol.  Initially suppose there is no physical link
    between AS2 and AS4.

    ![network](/static/img/kurose/fig04_p35.png)

    Suppose router $1d$ learns about $x$. It will put an entry (x,I) in its forwarding table.

    a. Will $I$ be equal to $I_1$ or $I_2$ for this entry? Explain why in one sentence.

    b. Now suppose that there is a physical link between AS2 and AS4,
    shown by the dotted line. Suppose router $1d$ learns that $x$ is
    accessible via AS2 as well as via AS3. Will $I$ be set to $I_1$ or $I_2$?
    Explain why in one sentence.
    
    c. Now suppose there is another AS, called AS5, which lies on the
    path between AS2 and AS4 (not shown in diagram). Suppose router 1d
    learns that x is accessible via AS2 AS5 AS4 as well as via AS3
    AS4. Will $I$ be set to $I_1$ or $I_2$ ? Explain why in one sentence.

1. Kurose & Ross, Chapter 4, Problem P39.

    Consider the following network.

    ![network](/static/img/kurose/fig04_p37.png)

    ISP B provides national backbone service to regional ISP A. ISP C
    provides national backbone service to regional ISP D. Each ISP
    consists of one AS. B and C peer with each other in two places
    using BGP. Consider traffic going from A to D. B would prefer to
    hand that traffic over to C on the West Coast (so that C would
    have to absorb the cost of carrying the traffic cross-country),
    while C would prefer to get the traffic via its East Coast peering
    point with B (so that B would have carried the traffic across the
    country). What BGP mechanism might C use, so that B would hand
    over A-to-D traffic at its East Coast peering point? To answer
    this question, you will __not__ need to dig into the BGP
    specification.

1. Kurose & Ross, Chapter 4, Problem P47.

    Consider the topology shown below. Suppose that all links have
    unit cost and that node E is the broadcast source. Using arrows
    like those shown in the figure, indicate links over which packets
    will be forwarded using RPF, and links over which packets will not
    be forwarded, given that node E is the source.

1. Kurose & Ross, Chapter 4, Problem P49.

    Consider the topology shown below, and suppose that each link has
    unit cost.

    ![network](/static/img/kurose/fig04_p47.png)

    Suppose node C is chosen as the center in a center-based multicast
    routing algorithm. Assuming that each attached router uses its
    least-cost path to node C to send join messages to C, draw the
    resulting center-based routing tree. Is the resulting tree a
    minimum-cost tree? Justify your answer.

1. Kurose & Ross, Chapter 4, Problem P55.

    What is the size of the multicast address space? Suppose now that
    two multicast groups randomly choose a multicast address. What is
    the probability that they choose the same address? Suppose now
    that 1,000 multicast groups are ongoing at the same time and
    choose their multicast group addresses at random. What is the
    probability that they interfere with each other? Hint: use an
    approximation for the birthday problem.
