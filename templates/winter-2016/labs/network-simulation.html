# Lab: Network Simulation

In this lab, you will learn about network simulation using a
packet-level, event-driven simulator.  You will use the simulator to
setup some basic networks and verify its accuracy with respect to
delay and loss.  You will also examine the basic queueing theory
result that delay grows exponentially as utilization approaches 100%.

## Simulator

I have written a simple network simulator called
[Bene](https://github.com/zappala/bene). This simulator includes a
basic event scheduler, plus objects for nodes, links, and packets. The
simulator allows you to setup basic networks with static routes and
send packets between any pair of connected nodes.

Please see the [Bene Wiki](https://github.com/zappala/bene/wiki) for
documentation.

## Two Nodes

Use the simulator to setup a simple network consisting of two nodes and
and one bidirectional link:

![network](/static/img/two-nodes-one-link.png)

Note that to do this in the simulator, you must create a
unidirectional link from _n1_ to _n2_, and another one from _n2_ to
_n1_.

Using this network, test the following scenarios:

1. Set the bandwidth of the links to 1 Mbps, with a propagation delay
of 1 second. Send one packet with 1000 bytes from _n1_ to _n2_ at time 0.

1. Set the bandwidth of the links to 100 bps, with a propagation delay
of 10 ms. Send one packet witih 1000 bytes from _n1_ to _n2_ at time 0.

1. Set the bandwidth of the links to 1 Mbps, with a propagation delay
of 10 ms.  Send three packets from _n1_ to _n2_ at time 0 seconds,
then one packet at time 2 seconds. All packets should have 1000 bytes.

For each scenario, print the time each packet was created, its
identifier, and the time it was received

For this section of your report, describe each network you have set
up. Show the portion of your code that creates each network and list
all of the parameters. Then, calculate the delay by hand, and show
that the simulator is accurate.

## Three Nodes

Use the simulator to setup a simple network consisting of three nodes
and two links. Using this network, test the following scenarios:

1. Two fast links

    ![network](/static/img/two-hop-1.png)

    Node A transmits a stream of 1 kB packets to node C. How long does
    it take to transfer a 1 MB file, divided into 1 kB packets, from A
    to C?  Which type of delay dominates?

    If both links are upgraded to a rate of 1 Gbps, how long does it
    take to transfer a 1 MB file from A to C?

2. One fast link and one slow link

    ![network](/static/img/two-hop-2.png)

    Node A transmits 1000 packets, each of size 1 kB, to node C. How
    long would it does it take to transfer a 1 MB file, divided into 1
    kB packets, from A to C?

Note that 1 kB = 10<sup>3</sup> bytes and 1 MB = 10<sup>6</sup>
bytes. These problems are the same as in the [first
homework](http://cs460.byu.edu/winter-2014/homework/networks-and-delay),
so you should get the same answers in both cases.

For this section of your report, describe each network you have set
up. Show the portion of your code that creates each network and list
all of the parameters. Then, show the output of the simulator and
explain how you know it is correct.

## Queueing Theory

Explore whether the simulator can validate basic queueing theory by
varying the rate at which packets are generated and measuring the
queueing delay for each packet. Queueing theory says that for an M/D/1
queue, the delay should go to infinity as the utilization of the
system goes to 1. Recall that the "M" in M/D/1 refers to an
exponential distribution on the arrival process, the "D" refers to a
deterministic service time, and the "1" refers to a single queue.

Choose a utilization between 0 and 100%, run a simulation, and collect
the results. Repeat for utilizations of 10% to 90%, plus 95% and 98%
of the maximum link rate. The maximum rate is given by your packet
length and link speed. The code in `examples/delay.py` shows how to
generate packets with an exponential distribution.

Each experiment should write its output to a file. Write a Python
script that parses the output files from each experiment and produces
a line graph of the average queueing delay as a function of link
utilization. On the same graph, plot the theoretical queueing delay
for the link using the equation w = 1/(2&mu;) x &rho;/(1-&rho;). Your
graph should look similar to this:

![combined-box](/static/img/combined-average.png)

Your plots must use Python and pandas. You can use the [sample
plotting code](https://github.com/zappala/python-plotting) as a
starting point for plotting.

For this section of your report, show the code you used to setup these
experiments, and describe the data you collected. Then show the graph
you created and discuss how well the simulator matches the theoretical
result.

## Report

Write a formal, scientific report that has a section for each of the
parts of the lab. Your report should be written as if you are
explaining your work to another CS student, and they need all of the
details of what you did so that they can replicate your experiments.

Your report can be any length, as long as you thoroughly describe your
project and results. The paper must use 11 point type, single spacing,
and one column per page.

You must use LaTex to write your report. This will make it easy for
you to include code and graphs and give them a consistent style. You
will also be able to easily regenerate your report whenever you change
your graphs, without having to copy and paste them each time. You can
use [this template](https://github.com/zappala/latex-report-template)
for your report.

LaTeX is a useful publishing tool in the academic world, as it
automatically formats a paper in many commonly-used conference and
journal styles. If I need to send a paper to a different venue,
changing one line in a LaTeX file will reformat the paper for
submisison to this venue. LaTeX handles all of the formatting you
would otherwise have to do by hand -- margins, section headings,
placement of figures, and more. I also find it helps me to focus on
content, rather than style, when I am writing a paper.

To help you learn LaTeX, I suggest using the [WikiBooks LaTex
reference](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX).

## Submission

Your code and should be located in a directory called lab1 in the top
level:

<pre>
bene/
  src/
  examples/
  lab1/
</pre>

Turn in a tarball that includes all of your code (for the simulator,
experiments, graphing, etc), and a PDF of your report:

<pre>
tar -czvf bene.tgz bene
</pre>

using Learning Suite.

## Grading

This lab is worth 100 points, and will be graded using the following rubric:

* Two Nodes: 30 points, 10 points per scenario

* Three Nodes: 20 points, 10 points per scenario.

* Queueing Theory: 50 points.

Each part will be graded on the following scale:

* 50% for partial work that indicates substantial effort was made
* 70% - 80% for C quality work
* 80% - 90% for B quality work
* 90% - 100% for A quality work

To get full points, the report must be complete and written with a
scientific style.
