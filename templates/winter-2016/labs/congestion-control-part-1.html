# Lab: Congestion Control Part 1

In this lab, you will add congestion control to your reliable
transport protocol. You will use the simulator to examine the
correctness of your implementation.

## TCP Tahoe

Implement congestion control using TCP Tahoe as your model. This
should include the following features:

* Slow start. At the start of the connection, or after any kind of
  loss event, set cwnd (congestion window) to 1 MSS. Every time the
  sender receives an ACK for new data, increment cwnd by the number of
  new bytes of data acknowledged.

* Threshold: Stop slow start when cwnd exceeds or equals the
  threshold. Start with a threshold of 100000 bytes.

* Additive Increase: Once cwnd is larger than the threshold, use
  additive increase. Every time the sender receives an ACK for new
  data, increment cwnd by MSS*b/cwnd, where MSS is the maximum segment
  size (1000 bytes) and b is the number of new bytes acknowledged.

* Fast Retransmit: A loss event is detected when there are three
  duplicate ACKs (meaning the fourth ACK in a row for the same
  sequence number), and TCP immediately retransmits instead of waiting
  for the retransmission timer.

* When a loss event is detected (a timeout or 3 duplicate ACKs), then
  set the threshold to max(cwnd/2,MSS) and set cwnd to 1 MSS.

## Graphing

Create a script that can produce the following type of graph:

* Sequence plot. On the X axis, plot time. On the Y
  axis, plot the sequence number divided by 1000 and mod 50. Each time
  a packet is transmitted by TCP (it is placed into the queue on the
  link), plot a square box at the appropriate X and Y values. If the
  packet is dropped, plot an X instead. In addition, each time TCP
  receives an ACK, plot a dot at the appropriate X and Y values.

You can use the [TCP Plotting using
Python](https://github.com/zappala/python-plotting-tcp) GitHub
repository for sample plotting code.

## Tests

Use a series of tests to demonstrate that your congestion control
algorithm works properly. Use a sequence plot graph to verify the
correct behavior in each case.

* Slow start: Transfer a small file such that the entire transmission
  occurs during slow start, with no loss. The window size should grow
  to cover at least 32 packets.  

* Additive increase: Repeat the above experiment, but with a slow
  start threshold of 16000 bytes (16 packets). Show that the rest of
  the transfer transitions to additive increase, with no loss.

* AIMD: Repeat the slow start test, but with a large threshold and a
  single packet dropped when the window has grown to 32000 bytes (32
  packets). You can do this with a small queue size on the link.  Show
  that when the loss occurs TCP restarts slow start up to a smaller
  threshold and then continues. Be sure the file is large enough to
  reach additive increase again after the loss.

* Burst loss: Repeat the AIMD test with multiple packets being lost at
  once. Show that Tahoe resets to slow start and recovers normally.

As a guide, use the graphs shown in the SACK paper we covered in
class.

## Report

Write a formal, scientific report that describes each of your tests. Include
your graphs in your report and discuss whether
you got the expected results.

Write using a formal, scientific report style. Your report should be
written as if you are explaining your work to another CS student, and
they need all of the details of what you did so that they can
replicate your experiments.

Your report can be any length, as long as you thoroughly describe your
project and results. The paper must use 11 point type, single spacing,
and one column per page.

Your report must match the LaTex style shown in [this
template](https://github.com/zappala/latex-report-template).  If you
choose to use LaTeX, I suggest using the [WikiBooks LaTex
reference](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX).

## Submission

Your code should be located in a directory called lab3 in the top level:

<pre> bene/ src/ examples/ lab3/ </pre>

Turn in a tarball that includes all of your code (for the simulator,
experiments, graphing, etc), and a PDF of your report:

<pre> tar -czvf bene.tgz bene </pre>

using Learning Suite.

## Grading

This lab is worth 150 points, and will be graded using the following
rubric:

* 50% for partial work that indicates substantial effort was made

* 70% - 80% for C quality work (Congestion control tests partly work,
the report is well written.)

* 80% - 90% for B quality work (Congestion control tests mostly work,
  the report is fair.)

* 90% - 100% for A quality work (Congestion control tests all work,
and the report is well written.)

* Extra 15 points for implementing Fast Recovery (Reno), which sets
  the congestion window to 1/2 the previous value instead of 1 MSS
  when loss is detected via duplicate ACKs.  You must be able to show
  Tahoe style congestion control in the rest of your report, and this
  section must use a sequence number plot to validate accuracy. Full
  points if you can show Reno reacting poorly to burst loss, like in
  the SACK paper.

To get full points, all experiments must work well and the report must
be complete and written with a scientific style.
