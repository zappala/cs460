# Applications

1. Kurose & Ross, Chapter 2, Problem P10.

    Consider a short, 10-meter link, over which a sender can transmit
    at a rate of 150 bps in both directions. Suppose that packets
    containing data are 100,000 bits long, and packets containing only
    control (e.g. ACK or handshaking) are 200 bits long. Assume that
    *N* parallel connections each get $1/N$ of the link bandwidth. Now
    consider the HTTP protocol, and suppose that each downloaded
    object is 100 Kbits long, and that the initial downloaded object
    references 10 additional objects from the same sender.

    a. Would parallel downloads via parallel instances of
    non-persistent HTTP make sense in this case?

    b. Now consider persistent HTTP. Do you expect significant gains
    over the non-persistent case? Justify and explain your answer.

1. Kurose & Ross, Chapter 2, Problem P11.

    Consider the scenario introduced in the previous problem. Now
    suppose that the link is shared by Bob with four other users. Bob
    uses parallel instances of non-persistent HTTP, and the other four
    users use non-persistent HTTP without parallel downloads.

    a. Do Bob's parallel connections help him get Web pages more
    quickly? Why or why not?

    b. If all five users open five parallel instances of
    non-persistent HTTP, then would Bob's parallel connections still
    be beneficial? Why or why not?

1. Kurose & Ross, Chapter 2, Problem P21.

    Suppose that your department has a local DNS server for all
    computers in the department. You are an ordinary user. Can you
    determine if an external web site was likely accessed from a
    computer in your department a couple of seconds ago? Explain.

1. Kurose & Ross, Chapter 2, Problem P26.

    Suppose Bob joins a BitTorrent torrent, but he does not want to
    upload any data to other peers (so-called free-riding).

    a. Bob claims that he can receive a complete copy of the file that
    is shared by the swarm. Is Bob's claim possible? Why or why not?

    b. Bob further claims that he can make his free-riding more
    efficient by using a collection of multiple computers (with
    distinct IP addresses) in the computer lab in his department. How
    can he do that?

1. BitTorrent uses incentives to encourage users to share the portions
of a file they have downloaded already. What problem could this cause
for a user who starts out without any of the file?  How could you
solve this problem without removing incentives entirely?  Would your
solution make it easier for free-loaders to download the file without
ever sharing anything?

1. Read the article titled [From .academy to .zone: An Analysis of the
New TLD Land Rush](From .academy to .zone: An Analysis of the New TLD
Land Rush) and write a three paragraph summary. The first paragraph
should summarize the problem the paper is trying to solve and why this
problem is important. The second paragrpah should summarize the
findings of the paper. In the third paragraph describe what this paper
taught you about the DNS system.
