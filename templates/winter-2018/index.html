# Syllabus

This is a course on how the Internet works, designed for
upper-division undergraduate and beginning graduate students. The
learning outcomes for this course are:

* understand the principles of the Internet architecture

* understand how the Internet works, from the transport layer down to
the physical layer

* gain hands-on experience with implementing and simulating transport,
routing, and MAC protocols, leading to a deeper understanding of these
critical Internet components

* be capable of reading and understanding research papers in the area
of computer networking

* demonstrate the ability to effectively conduct, describe and report
on an experimental research project in the area of computer networking

Topics this course covers include application-layer networking,
transport protocols, routing protocols, IP, link-level protocols,
wireless networking, and multimedia networking.

The prerequisite for the course is CS 324 Systems Programming.

To meet the goals of the course, students will complete written
homeworks, labs, and exams. The homeworks and exams will consist
primarily of written questions that ask the students to apply the
principles of network design to a given problem. The labs are designed
to provide a deeper understanding of how the Internet works by using
simulation.

## Textbooks

For the lecture material, we will use

> Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach Featuring the Internet,
> seventh edition, by James F. Kurose and Keith W. Ross, Addison
> Wesley, 2012, ISBN 0133594149, ISBN-13 978-0133594140.

Please buy this version of the book. There are important additions and
the homework problems are different. There are numerous options for
buying or renting this book, some of which are listed at the [Kurose &
Ross](http://kuroseross.com/) web site.

We will do a significant amount of Python programming in this
class. If you are not already familiar with the language, I suggest
you learn Python by using some of the free online resources that are
available, or a book.

* [Codecademy Python course](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python)

* [Learn Python Interactive Tutorial](http://www.learnpython.org/)

* [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer
  Scientist](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/)

* [Learning Python, 5th
  Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Python-Edition-Mark-Lutz/dp/1449355730/)

I also suggest that you become familiar with the official [Python
documentation](http://www.python.org/doc/).

## Computing Environment

We will be using a Linux environment for this class. You can use the
Linux labs, setup your laptop to boot into Linux, or setup a virtual
machine running Linux. We will be using Python 2.7, along with various
packages such as matplotlib and LaTeX.  You are strongly encouraged to
become familiar with Linux, its software, and the command-line
environment. Being fluent in multiple computing environments is an
important part of a CS education.

You will likely have good success using a Mac OS machine with the
required software, but you will need to do this on your own. Based on
past experience, I strongly discourage you from using Windows; you
should setup a virtual machine with Linux instead. Either way, your
code will be expected to run on a Linux machine when you submit it.

## Assignments and Grading Policy

The assignments for this class will consist of homework, labs, and
exams. Labs must be written in the assigned language and must compile
and run on a Linux machine.

Grading for homework problems is on a scale of 0 to 10 for each
problem, with a final score based on the total possible points. A
score of 10 indicates your answer is entirely correct (A), and a score
of 5 indicates your answer is entirely wrong but you made a reasonable
effort (E). Failure to make a reasonable effort to answer a question
scores a 0.

Labs will be graded using a rubric that indicates how many points each
part of the assignment is worth.

Details on exam format and grading will be forthcoming.

Your final grade will be computed by weighting all scores as follows:

> Homework 20%

> Exams 30%

> Labs 50%

## Collaboration Policy

All homework must be completed individually. You are encouraged to
collaborate as much as possible, including discussing solutions and
solving problems together, as long as you write up your own answer
individually (e.g. do not copy someone else's solution directly).

You may work on labs either alone or using pair programming. If you
choose to use pair programming, the partners must trade off in the two
positions (at the keyboard, over the shoulder) during each lab. Each
pair will turn in the same assignment and will be required to sign a
statement indicating that they participated equally. If you are unable
to contribute equally, you should leave the partnership as soon as
this becomes evident. Regardless of whether you choose to work alone
or in a pair, you are encouraged to discuss solving the labs and any
programming problems you encounter generally, but you must write your
own code and should not view any other student's code. When producing
written work, your use of sources (ideas, quotations, paraphrases)
must be properly acknowledged and documented.

All exams must be completed individually.

## Late Policy

Homework and labs are due in class on the day indicated, and there are
no late days. Homework is due in class and labs are due at midnight.

If you have a medical or serious personal issue, please see the
instructor to make arrangements for late work. You may always turn in
partial work if you are not finished and you will be graded on what
you have accomplished. I am happy to make accommodations for a
learning disability if you turn in an accommodations letter to me. No
work can be turned in after the university's last day of instruction.

Exams must be taken on the scheduled day. Medical exceptions are
always available, but please notify the instructor in advance or as
soon as possible. Non-medical exceptions (e.g. traveling to a job
interview) can be made in advance with sufficient notice.

## Educational Policies

### Honor Code Standards

In keeping with the principles of the [BYU Honor
Code](http://honorcode.byu.edu/), students are expected to be honest
in all of their academic work.  Academic honesty means, most
fundamentally, that any work you present as your own must in fact be
your own work and not that of another. Violations of this principle
may result in a failing grade in the course and additional
disciplinary action by the university.

### Policy on Harassment

Harassment of any kind is inappropriate at BYU. Specifically, BYU's
policy against sexual harassment extends not only to employees of the
university but to students as well. If you encounter sexual
harassment, gender-based discrimination, or other inappropriate
behavior, please talk to your professor, contact the Equal Employment
Office at 422-5895 or 367-5689, or contact the Honor Code Office at
422-2847.

### Students with Disabilities

BYU is committed to providing reasonable accommodation to qualified
persons with disabilities. If you have any disability that may
adversely affect your success in this course, please contact the
University Accessibility Center at 422-2767. Services deemed
appropriate will be coordinated with the student and instructor by
that office.
